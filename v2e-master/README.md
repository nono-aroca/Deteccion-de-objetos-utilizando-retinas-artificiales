## Environment

We encourage you to fork v2e and suggest pulls to improve the functionality.

**NOTE** We recommend running _v2e_ on a CUDA GPU or it will be very slow. With a low-end GTX-1050, _v2e_ runs about 50-200X slower than real time using 10X slowdown factor and 346x260 video.

```
python==3.7.7
Ubuntu 18.04 or Windows 10x64
CUDA GPU 
```
(if you have not used CUDA on your GPU, you might need to install it from https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)

Code includes pycharm project files for your convenience.

We highly recommend running the code in a virtual environment. Conda is always your best friend. :).
See https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#create-env-from-file


For conda users, you can create your _v2e_ environment and install everything to it with
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```


You can then update everything in your _v2e_ conda environment with the following:

```bash
conda create -n v2e python=3.7 pip
conda activate v2e
conda env update --prefix ./v2e --file environment.yml
```

To save your conda environment, use
```bash
conda env export --from-history >myenvironment.yml
```

Part of the v2e is `numba` accelerated, please install it via:

```bash
pip install numba
```
#### Note about Gooey during environment install
If you get error about installing the Gooey library, you can comment it out from requirements.txt or environment.yml.
[Gooey](https://github.com/chriskiehl/Gooey) is a libary that enables a GUI inteface for running v2e. It is optional. If you do not install Gooey then you run v2e from the command line or IDE launchers.
On some platforms (linux) Gooey can be very hard to install because the required python wheels are not available. (A python _wheel_ is an archive named in a particular way to indentify the target platform.)


## Install the Package

Install v2e will make it available on your python path.

1. For developers, you should install the package with `develop` (in your virtual environment):

    ```bash
    pip install -e .
    ```
  
Using -e will let you modify the code and see the results in your runtime without installing again.
See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19048732/python-setup-py-develop-vs-install .

2. For users of _v2e.py_, you can install the package with `install`:

    ```bash
    pip install .
    ```
   
## Usage

_v2e_ serves multiple purposes. Please read to code if you would like to adapt it for your own application. Here, we only introduce the usage for generating DVS events from conventional video and from specific datasets.

### GUI interface
A GUI based on Gooey is automatically started if Gooey is installed. (Gooey uses wxPython which can be hard to install on linux systems; see above.)  To disable the GUI, you can use the --ignore-gooey option.  Gooey preloads its GUI with the command line options you provide. You can then run v2e multiple times from the same GUI.

For a sample of conversion using the gooey GUI, see https://youtu.be/THJqRC_q2kY

## Sample input data
The _SuperSoMo_ model and sample input videos to try _v2e_ with are in [v2e-sample-input-data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1oWxTB9sMPp6UylAdxg5O1ko_GaIXz7wo?usp=sharing) on google drive.

## Download SuperSloMo model

We use the excellent [Super SloMo](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~hzjiang/projects/superslomo/) framework to interpolate the APS frames. 
However, since APS frames only record light intensity, we  retrained it on grayscale images. 
You can download our pre-trained model checkpoint from Google Drive 
[[link]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17QSN207h05S_b2ndXjLrqPbBTnYIl0Vb/view?usp=sharing) (151 MB).


```bash
mkdir -p input
mv SuperSloMo39.ckpt ./input
```
The default value of --slomo_model argument is set to this location.

## Render emulated DVS events from conventional video.

_v2e.py_ reads a standard video (e.g. in .avi, .mp4, .mov, or .wmv) and generates emulated DVS events at upsampled timestamp resolution.

Do not be intimidated by the huge number of options. Running _v2e.py_ with no arguments sets reasonable values and opens a file browser to let you select an input video. Inspect the logging output for hints.

**Hint:** Note the options _[--dvs128 | --dvs240 | --dvs346 | --dvs640 | --dvs1024]_; they set output size and width to popular cameras.

v2e: generate simulated DVS events from video.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

Output: General:
  -o OUTPUT_FOLDER, --output_folder OUTPUT_FOLDER
                        folder to store outputs. (default: v2e-output)
  --avi_frame_rate AVI_FRAME_RATE
                        frame rate of output AVI video files; only affects
                        playback rate. (default: 30)
  --output_in_place [OUTPUT_IN_PLACE]
                        store output files in same folder as source video.
                        (default: True)
  --overwrite           overwrites files in existing folder (checks existence
                        of non-empty output_folder). (default: False)
  --unique_output_folder [UNIQUE_OUTPUT_FOLDER]
                        If specifying --output_folder, makes unique output
                        folder based on output_folder, e.g. output1 (if non-
                        empty output_folder already exists) (default: True)
  --no_preview          disable preview in cv2 windows for faster processing.
                        (default: False)

DVS timestamp resolution:
  --auto_timestamp_resolution [AUTO_TIMESTAMP_RESOLUTION]
                        (Ignored by --disable_slomo.) If True (default),
                        upsampling_factor is automatically determined to limit
                        maximum movement between frames to 1 pixel. If False,
                        --timestamp_resolution sets the upsampling factor for
                        input video. Can be combined with
                        --timestamp_resolution to ensure DVS events have at
                        most some resolution. (default: True)
  --timestamp_resolution TIMESTAMP_RESOLUTION
                        (Ignored by --disable_slomo.) Desired DVS timestamp
                        resolution in seconds; determines slow motion
                        upsampling factor; the video will be upsampled from
                        source fps to achieve the at least this timestamp
                        resolution.I.e. slowdown_factor =
                        (1/fps)/timestamp_resolution; using a high resolution
                        e.g. of 1ms will result in slow rendering since it
                        will force high upsampling ratio. Can be combind with
                        --auto_timestamp_resolution to limit upsampling to a
                        maximum limit value. (default: None)

DVS model:
  --output_height OUTPUT_HEIGHT
                        Height of output DVS data in pixels. If None, same as
                        input video. Use --output_height=260 for Davis346.
                        (default: None)
  --output_width OUTPUT_WIDTH
                        Width of output DVS data in pixels. If None, same as
                        input video. Use --output_width=346 for Davis346.
                        (default: None)
  --dvs_params DVS_PARAMS
                        Easy optional setting of parameters for DVS
                        model:None, 'clean', 'noisy'; 'clean' turns off noise
                        and makes threshold variation zero. 'noisy' sets
                        limited bandwidth and adds leak events and shot
                        noise.This option by default will disable user set DVS
                        parameters. To use custom DVS paramters, use None
                        here. (default: None)
  --pos_thres POS_THRES
                        threshold in log_e intensity change to trigger a
                        positive event. (default: 0.2)
  --neg_thres NEG_THRES
                        threshold in log_e intensity change to trigger a
                        negative event. (default: 0.2)
  --sigma_thres SIGMA_THRES
                        1-std deviation threshold variation in log_e intensity
                        change. (default: 0.03)
  --cutoff_hz CUTOFF_HZ
                        photoreceptor second-order IIR lowpass filter cutoff-
                        off 3dB frequency in Hz - see
                        https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4444573 (default:

  --leak_rate_hz LEAK_RATE_HZ
                        leak event rate per pixel in Hz - see
                        https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7962235
                        (default: 0.01)
  --shot_noise_rate_hz SHOT_NOISE_RATE_HZ
                        Temporal noise rate of ON+OFF events in darkest parts
                        of scene; reduced in brightest parts. (default: 0.001)
  --dvs_emulator_seed DVS_EMULATOR_SEED
                        Set to a integer >0 to use a fixed random seed.default
                        is 0 which means the random seed is not fixed.
                        (default: 0)
  --show_dvs_model_state SHOW_DVS_MODEL_STATE
                        one of new_frame baseLogFrame lpLogFrame0 lpLogFrame1
                        diff_frame (without quotes) (default: None)

SloMo upsampling (see also "DVS timestamp resolution" group):
  --disable_slomo       Disables slomo interpolation; the output DVS events
                        will have exactly the timestamp resolution of the
                        source video (which is perhaps modified by
                        --input_slowmotion_factor). (default: False)
  --slomo_model SLOMO_MODEL
                        path of slomo_model checkpoint. (default:
                        input/SuperSloMo39.ckpt)
  --batch_size BATCH_SIZE
                        Batch size in frames for SuperSloMo. Batch size 8-16
                        is recommended if your GPU has sufficient memory.
                        (default: 8)
  --vid_orig VID_ORIG   Output src video at same rate as slomo video (with
                        duplicated frames). (default: video_orig.avi)
  --vid_slomo VID_SLOMO
                        Output slomo of src video slowed down by
                        slowdown_factor. (default: video_slomo.avi)
  --slomo_stats_plot    show a plot of slomo statistics (default: False)

Input file handling:
  -i INPUT, --input INPUT
                        Input video file or a image folder; leave empty for
                        file chooser dialog.If the input is a folder, the
                        folder should contain a ordered list of image files.In
                        addition, the user has to set the frame rate manually.
                        (default: None)
  --input_frame_rate INPUT_FRAME_RATE
                        Manually define the video frame rate when the video is
                        presented as a list of image files.When the input
                        video is a video file, this option will be ignored.
                        (default: None)
  --input_slowmotion_factor INPUT_SLOWMOTION_FACTOR
                        Sets the known slow-motion factor of the input video,
                        i.e. how much the video is slowed down, i.e., the
                        ratio of shooting frame rate to playback frame rate.
                        input_slowmotion_factor<1 for sped-up video and
                        input_slowmotion_factor>1 for slowmotion video.If an
                        input video is shot at 120fps yet is presented as a
                        30fps video (has specified playback frame rate of
                        30Hz, according to file's FPS setting), then set
                        --input_slowdown_factor=4.It means that each input
                        frame represents (1/30)/4 s=(1/120)s.If input is video
                        with intended frame intervals of 1ms that is in AVI
                        file with default 30 FPS playback spec, then use
                        ((1/30)s)*(1000Hz)=33.33333. (default: 1.0)
  --start_time START_TIME
                        Start at this time in seconds in video. Use None to
                        start at beginning of source video. (default: None)
  --stop_time STOP_TIME
                        Stop at this time in seconds in video. Use None to end
                        at end of source video. (default: None)

Synthetic input:
  --synthetic_input SYNTHETIC_INPUT
                        Input from class SYNTHETIC_INPUT that has methods
                        next_frame() and total_frames().Disables file input
                        and SuperSloMo frame interpolation.
                        SYNTHETIC_INPUT.next_frame() should return a frame of
                        the correct resolution (see DVS model arguments) which
                        is array[y][x] with pixel [0][0] at upper left corner
                        and pixel values 0-255. SYNTHETIC_INPUT must be
                        resolvable from the classpath. SYNTHETIC_INPUT is the
                        module name without .py suffix.See example
                        moving_dot.py. (default: None)

You can put [tennis.mov](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dNUXJGlpEM51UVYH4-ZInN9pf0bHGgT_/view?usp=sharing) in the _input_ folder to try it out with the command line below.  Or leave out all options and just use the file chooser to select the movie.

```
python v2e.py -i input/tennis.mov --overwrite --timestamp_resolution=.003 --auto_timestamp_resolution=False --dvs_exposure duration 0.005 --output_folder=output/tennis --overwrite --pos_thres=.15 --neg_thres=.15 --sigma_thres=0.03 --dvs_aedat2 tennis.aedat --output_width=346 --output_height=260 --stop_time=3 --cutoff_hz=15 
```
Run the command above, and the following files will be created in a folder called _output/tennis_.

```
dvs-video.avi
dvs-video-frame_times.txt
tennis.aedat
v2e-args.txt
video_orig.avi
video_slomo.avi

```

* _dvs-video.avi_: DVS video (with playback rate 30Hz) but with frame rate (DVS timestamp resolution) set by source video frame rate times slowdown_factor.
* _dvs-video-frame_times.txt_: The times of the DVS frames. Useful when _--dvs_exposure count_ or _--dvs_exposure area-count_ methods are used.
* _tennis.aedat_: AEDAT-2.0 file for playback and algorithm experiments in [jAER](https://jaerproject.net) (use the AEChip _Davis346Blue_ to play this file.)
* _v2e-args.txt_: All the parameters and logging output from the run.
* _video_orig.avi_: input video, but converted to luma and resized to output (width,height) and with repeated frames to allow comparison to _slomo.avi_.
* _video_slomo.avi_: slow motion video (with playback rate 30Hz) but slowed down by slowdown_factor.

The [v2e site](https://sites.google.com/view/video2events/home) shows these videos.

## Model parameters

The DVS ON and OFF threshold nominal values are set by _pos_thres_ and _neg_thres_. The pixel to pixel variation is set by _sigma_thres_. The pixel cutoff frequency in Hz is set by _cutoff_hz_. The leak event rate is set by _leak_rate_hz_. 

The _-dvs_params_ argument sets reasonable DVS model parameters for high and low light conditions.

See our technical paper for futher information about these parameters.
 
 ### Automatic vs manual DVS timestamp resolution
 The output DVS timestamps will be quantized to some value depending on options chosen.
 
  *  _--disable_slomo_ will disable slomo interpolation and the DVS events will have exactly the times of the input video, perhaps modified by --input_slowmotion_factor
  *  _--timestamp_resolution=X_ will upsample as needed to obtain this desired timestamp resolution _X_ in seconds. If auto_timestamp_resolution is set, then timestamp_resolution will still set the minimum timestamp resolution, i.e. if automatic timestamping would result in 5ms timestamps but timestamp_resolution is 1ms, then 1ms will still be the timestamp resolution.
  *  _--auto_timestamp_resolution_ will upsample in each _--batch_size_ frames using the computed optical flow to limit motion per frame to at most 1 pixel. In this case, turning on _--slomo_stats_plot_ will generate a plot like the following, which came from a driving video where the car sped up during part of the video:
 
 ![auto_slomo_stats](media/slomo_stats.png)
 
 This plot shows the actual timestamps of the interpolated frames (in orange) and the frame intervals for each batch of frames (in blue).
 
### Photoreceptor lowpass filtering
_v2e_ includes an intensity-dependent 1st-order lowpass filtering of light intensity; see the paper for details. 
If you set a nonzero --cutofffreq_hz, then it is important that the sample rate be high enough to allow the IIR lowpass filters to update properly, i.e.
the time constant tau of the lowpass filters must be at least 3 times larger than the frame interval.
Check the console output for warnings about undersampling for lowpass filtering.


 
 ### Frame rate and DVS timestamp resolution in v2e
There are several different 'frame rates' in v2e. On opening the input video, v2e reads the frame rate of the video and assumes the video is shot in real time, except that you can specify a _--input_slowmotion_factor_ slowdown_factor if the video is already a slow-motion video. The desired DVS timestamp resolution is combined with the source frame rate to compute the slow-motion upsampling factor. The output DVS AVI video is then generated using a _--dvs-exposure_ method.

 * _--avi_frame_rate_: Just sets the frame rate for playback of output AVI files
 * _--dvs-exposure_: See next section
 * --input_slowmotion_factor_: Specifies by what factor the input video is slowed down.
 

## DVS frame exposure modes

The DVS allows arbritrary frame rates. _v2e_ provides 3 methods to 'expose' DVS video frames, which are selected by the
--dvs_exposure argument:
 1. **Constant-Duration**: _--dvs_exposure _duration_ _T__:  - Each frame has constant duration _T_.
 2. **Constant-Count**: _--dvs_exposure_count_ _N_:  - each frame has the same number _N_ of DVS events, as first described in Delbruck, Tobi. 2008. “Frame-Free Dynamic Digital Vision.” In Proceedings of Intl. Symp. on Secure-Life Electronics, Advanced Electronics for Quality Life and Society, 1:21–26. Tokyo, Japan: Tokyo. https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzvXOhBHjRheTS1rSVlZN0l2MDg..
 3. **Area-Event**: _--dvs_exposure_ _area_event_ _N_ _M_:  - frames are accumulated until any block of *M*x*M* pixels fills up with _N_ events, as first described in Liu, Min, and T. Delbruck. 2018. “Adaptive Time-Slice Block-Matching Optical Flow Algorithm for Dynamic Vision Sensors.” In Proceedings of British Machine Vision Conference (BMVC 2018). Newcastle upon Tyne, UK: Proceedings of BMVC 2018. https://doi.org/10.5167/uzh-168589.

 - _Constant-Duration_ is like normal video, i.e. sampled at regular, ideally Nyquist rate. 
 - _Constant-Count_ frames have the same number of pixel brightness change events per frame. But if the scene is very textured (i.e. busy) then frame can get very brief, while parts of the input with only a small object moving can have very long frames.
 - _Area-Event_ compensates for this effect to some extent by concluding exposure when any block of pixels fills with a constant count.

## DAVIS camera conversion Dataset

v2e can convert recordings from
 [DDD20](https://sites.google.com/view/davis-driving-dataset-2020/home) and the original [DDD17](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HM0CSmjO8nOpUeTvmPjopcBcVCk7KXvLUuiZFS6TWSg/pub) 
which are the first public end-to-end training datasets 
of automotive driving using a DAVIS event + frame camera. It lets you compare the real DVS data with the conversion. 
This dataset is maintained by the Sensors Research Group of Institute of Neuroinformatics. 

For your convenience, we offer via google drive one recording from _DDD20_ (our newer DDD dataset) of 800s of
Los Angeles street driving. 
The file is _aug04/rec1501902136.hdf5_ [[link]](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1KIaHsn72ZpVBZR6SGeFcd2lILyZoD2-5)
  in Google Drive for you to try it with v2e (***Warning:*** 2GB 7z compressed, 5.4 GB uncompressed).

```bash
mkdir -p input
mv rec1501902136.hdf5 ./input
```

**NOTE** you must run these scripts with the _-m package.script.py_ notation, not by directly pointing to the .py file.

### Extract data from DDD recording

_ddd_h5_extract_data.py_ extracts the DDD recording DVS events to jAER _.aedat_ and video _.avi_ files.

```
(pt-v2e) $ python -m dataset_scripts.ddd.ddd_extract_data.py -h
usage: ddd_h5_extract_data.py [-h] [-i INPUT] -o OUTPUT_FOLDER
                              [--start_time START_TIME]
                              [--stop_time STOP_TIME] [--rotate180]
                              [--overwrite]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i INPUT, --input INPUT
                        input video file; leave empty for file chooser dialog
  -o OUTPUT_FOLDER, --output_folder OUTPUT_FOLDER
                        folder to store outputs
  --start_time START_TIME
                        start at this time in seconds in video
  --stop_time STOP_TIME
                        stop point of video stream
  --rotate180           rotate output 180 deg
  --overwrite           overwrites files in existing folder (checks existance
                        of non-empty output_folder)

```
Running it from python console with
```python
runfile('E:\\Dropbox\\GitHub\\SensorsINI\\v2e\\ddd_extract_data.py', args=['--overwrite', '--output_folder=output/output-ddd-h5-data', '--overwrite', '--rotate180'], wdir='E:/Dropbox/GitHub/SensorsINI/v2e')
```
produces
```

output/output-ddd-h5-data/rec1501350986.avi
```
### Synthesize events from DDD recording

_ddd-v2e.py_ is like _v2e.py_ but it reads DDD .hdf5 recordings and extracts the real DVS events from the same part of the recording used for the synthesis of DVS events.

You can try it like this: 
```

## Estimate DVS Event Thresholds

_ddd_find_thresholds.py_ estimates the correct thresholds of triggering ON and OFF events, you can use a synhronized DAVIS recording from the DDD dataset:

```
$ python  -m dataset_scripts.ddd.ddd_find_thresholds.py -h
usage: ddd_find_thresholds.py [-h] [--start START] [--stop STOP] [-i I] [-o O]
                              [--slowdown_factor SLOWDOWN_FACTOR]
                              [--slomo_model SLOMO_MODEL] [--no_preview]

ddd_find_thresholds.py: generate simulated DVS events from video with sweep of
thresholds to compare with real DVS to find optimal thresholds.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --start START         start point of video stream (default: 0.0)
  --stop STOP           stop point of video stream (default: 5.0)
  -i I                  path of DDD .hdf5 file (default: None)
  -o O                  path to where output is stored (default:
                        output/find_thresholds)
  --slowdown_factor SLOWDOWN_FACTOR
                        slow motion factor (default: 10)
  --slomo_model SLOMO_MODEL
                        path of slomo_model checkpoint. (default:
                        input/SuperSloMo39.ckpt)
  --no_preview          disable preview in cv2 windows for faster processing.
                        (default: False)

Run with no --input to open file dialog

```
You can run it like this:

```bash
python  -m dataset_scripts.ddd.ddd_find_thresholds.py -i input\rec1501350986.hdf5 --start 25 --stop 35
```
Make sure you use part of the recording where the input is changing. If you use the ROI option you can focus the estimation on parts of the scene that are definitely changing, to avoid counting just noise events. If you happen to select such a region, then _ddd_find_thresholds.py_ will find an artificially low threshold to generate enough events compared with the real DVS (if you don't set the correct _leak_rate_hz_ and _shot_noise_rate_hz_ parameters). 

The program will take the DVS recording data, which starts at time 'start' and ends at time 'end', to calculate the best threshold values for positive and negative self separately.

A typical result from _ddd_find_thresholds.py_ is shown below. It plots the absolute difference in ON and OFF event counts between the real and v2e data. ON counts are green and OFF counts are red. The smallest difference between real and v2e DVS event counts is found at about 0.3. It means that this recording use a DVS threshold of about 0.3 log_e units, or about +35% and -25% intensity change.

![find_threshold_plot](media/find_thresholds.png)

We have observed that some DDD videos suggest extremely low DVS thresholds by using _ddd_find_thresholds.py_. We believe it is because the DAVIS recording APS frames nonlinearly represent intensity, i.g. the APS values tend to saturate with intensity. It means that _ddd_find_thresholds.py_  estimates unrealistically-low DVS thresholds (7%-9%), so that v2e generates sufficient DVS events to match the real event counts.

### Obtaining acceptable results 
For the best frame interpolation by SuperSloMo, the input video needs to satisfy the requirements below,

- Daytime - for short exposure times to avoid motion-blurred frames.
- Cloudy - for limited dynamic range, to ensure that the frames are not clipped.
- High frame rate - objects must not be aliased too much, i.e. they must not move too much between frames.

If the video is underexposed, overexposed, has motion blur or aliasing, then the emulated DVS events will have poor realism.

### Default Thresholds ####
_pos_thres_: 0.25
_neg_thres_: 0.35
Both of them are approximated based on the file rec1500403661.hdf5.

**NOTE** 

The thresholds vary slightly depending on the time interval of the input APS frames.

|  Time Interval   |  _pos_thres_ | _neg_thres_ |
|  ----  | ----  | ----|
| 5s - 15s  | 0.25 | 0.36|
| 15s - 25s  | 0.24 | 0.33|
| 25s - 35s  | 0.21 | 0.31|
| 35s - 45s  | 0.22 | 0.33|

All the thresholds above are estimated based on the file rec1500403661.hdf5. The estimated thresholds also slightly vary depending on the input file. For example, based on the APS frames in the time interval 35s - 45s from the file rec1499025222.hdf5, the estimated positive threshold is 0.28, and the estimated negative threshold is 0.42.



### Plot the DDD event counts from v2e versus real DVS

After running _ddd-v2e.py_, _ddd_plot_event_counts.py_ reads the saved numpy files holding the real and v2e events from _ddd-v2e.py_ (**if you enabled --numpy_output**) and plots the event counts over an ROI. 

Running it like below
```bash
python -m dataset_scripts.ddd.ddd_plot_event_counts.py --path output\ddd20-v2e-short --start 0 --stop 2 --x 0 345 --y 0 259
```
produces the output
![real vs v2e DVS event counts](media/ddd-plot-event-counts.png)

This run used the default bin duration of 50ms. The plot shows the count of ON and OFF events over the entire pixel array for real DVS and emulated v2e. We can see that the ON threshold is approximately correct, while the OFF threshold for v2e was too small; too many v2e events were generated.

Another example is shown below: The left side is the ground-truth DVS frames, and the figure on the right side shows the histogram plot of the generated DVS events within the region denoted by the black box. Histograms of the ground-truth self and our generated self are plotted in the same figure. It can be seen that the distribution of generated v2e events is quite similar to the distribution of the real DVS events.

## Working with jAER DAVIS recordings

DAVIS cameras like the one that recorded DDD17 and DDD20 are often used with [jAER](https://jaerproject.net) (although DDD recordings were made with custom python wrapper around caer). _v2e_ will output a jAER-compatible .aedat file in [AEDAT-2.0 format](https://inivation.com/support/software/fileformat/#aedat-20), which jAER uses.

To work with existing jAER DAVIS .aedat, you can export the DAVIS APS frames using the jAER EventFilter [DavisFrameAVIWriter](https://github.com/SensorsINI/jaer/blob/master/src/ch/unizh/ini/jaer/projects/davis/frames/DavisFrameAviWriter.java); see the [jAER user guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fb7VA8tdoxuYqZfrPfT46_wiT1isQZwTHgX8O22dJ0Q/edit?usp=sharing), in particular, the [section about using DavisFrameAVIWriter](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fb7VA8tdoxuYqZfrPfT46_wiT1isQZwTHgX8O22dJ0Q/edit#heading=h.g4cschniofmo). In DavisFrameAVIWriter, **don't forget to set the frameRate to the actual frame rate of the DAVIS frames** (which you can see at the top of the jAER display). This will make the conversion have approximately the correct DVS event timing. (jAER can drop APS frames if there are too many DVS events, so don't count on this.) Once you have the AVI from jAER, you can generate v2e events from it with _v2e.py_ and see how they compare with the original DVS events in jAER, by playing the exported v2e .aedat file in jAER.

An example of this conversion and comparison is on the [v2e home page](https://sites.google.com/view/video2events/home).

## Generating Synthetic DVS Dataset from UCF-101 action recognition dataset ##

**NOT CURRENTLY WORKING**

_ucf101_single.py_ generates synthetic data from a single input video from the action recognition dataset [UCF-101](https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/data/UCF101.php).

```bash
python ucf101_single.py \
--input [path to the input video] \
--pos_thres [positive threshold] \
--neg_thres [negative threshold] \
--sf [slow motion factor] \
--checkpoint [the .ckpt checkpoint of the slow motion network] \
--output_dir [path to store the output videos]
```

The code needs to be modified if the input video is from a different dataset.

## Technical Details ##
